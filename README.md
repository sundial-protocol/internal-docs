# internal-docs

A repo to house private documentation and anything that doesn't fit cleanly into the docs repo

These documents are currently split into the following categories:

- Architecture
  - Layers
  - Roles
- Reports

`/architecture/` documents are intended to provide a high-level overview of the protocol, its components, and how they interact.

`/architecture/layers/` contains documents that describe the different layers of the protocol, their functions, and how they interact with each other.

`/architecture/roles/` contains documents that describe the different roles within the Sundial ecosystem, their responsibilities, and how they contribute to the overall functioning of the protocol.

`/reports/` contains various reports related to the project, including Catalyst reviews and feedback.

Catalyst Reviewers, please see the [Feedback Answers Document](./reports/Catalyst%20Feedback%20Answers.pdf) for our responses to your questions.
