- **King David (4/29 12:04 PM):** section 2 is just AI place holder, but overall branding is sun/planet subtlety.
- **Sheldon (4/29 3:53 PM):** https://www.anastasialabs.com/ — Dis gud

**May 1 – May 6, 2025**

- **gUbGuuB (5/1 2:18 PM):** ADDED @King David @sdelaney FOR TOMORROWS WEBSITE CALL. IT'S THE PPL WHO MADE A PLACEHOLDER SITE TO SEE WHAT'S NEXT OR IF WE SHOULD MOVE TO ACTAUL SITE SOON
- **gUbGuuB (5/1 7:59 PM):** https://babylonlabs.io/ — ALSO, FORGOT TO LINK THIS REFERENEC
- **gUbGuuB (5/2 7:35 AM):** DO YOU WANT TO GO OVER WHAT WE HAVE SO FAR AFTER THIS? WE SHOULD MOVE TO THE ACTUAL SITE BEFORE CONSENSUS NEXT WEEK
- **gUbGuuB (5/2 8:10 AM):** AH, NVM NOT BEFORE CONSENSUS THEN. HAVE GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME TO WORK ON THE ACTUAL SITE. APPOLD IS MOSTLY HELPING WITH RESEARCH AND STUFF, SO THIS BROCHURE SITE WE SHOULDN'T SPEND MUCH MORE TIME ON
- **sdelaney (5/2 4:37 PM):** Anastasia Labs style advanced features section
<video controls src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d2167ea-afd6-422b-95f7-953ae604aca9" title="Title"></video>
- **sdelaney (5/5 5:35 PM):** proof of concept for a fancy roadmap page. before I put more time into polishing it up - is this too much?

- **King David (5/5 5:58 PM):** mock #3 ![Images](./menu_closed.png) ![Images](./menu_open.png) ![Images](./n1.png) ![Images](v1.png) ![Images](./v2.png) ![Images](./v3.png)
- **gUbGuuB (5/5 6:01 PM):** NICE! NOTES COULD BE NIGHT BOTTOM CAN BE CHANGED TO A SHADPW FROM AN ACTUAL SUNDIAL ON THE TOP. BITCOIN AS THE SUN. AND HOLES IN THE SUNDIAL CUTOUT WITH THE WORDS SO IT HAS IT IN THE SHADIQ
- **sdelaney (5/6 8:05 AM):** the sundial shadow shouldn't be too hard, but the cutout words sounds pretty hard. I'll givem a try. btc as the sun should be easy
- **sdelaney (5/6 8:22 AM):** I like the flat hero section! looks v good. thinking a combination of 1, 2 up top & 6 below with the features section from 4. @Sheldon you mind if I tweet this on my personal account just to show off the effect? Hid the sundial branding so it won't get connected to this project if we decide not to go with it.
- **Sheldon (5/6 10:40 AM):** Super cool. APPROVED!
