- **Sheldon (4/29 3:53 PM):** https://www.anastasialabs.com/ â€” Dis gud

**May 1 â€“ May 6, 2025**

- **gUbGuuB (5/1 2:18 PM):** ADDED @King David @sdelaney FOR TOMORROWS WEBSITE CALL. IT'S THE PPL WHO MADE A PLACEHOLDER SITE TO SEE WHAT'S NEXT OR IF WE SHOULD MOVE TO ACTAUL SITE SOON
- **gUbGuuB (5/1 7:59 PM):** https://babylonlabs.io/ â€” ALSO, FORGOT TO LINK THIS REFERENEC
- **gUbGuuB (5/2 7:35 AM):** DO YOU WANT TO GO OVER WHAT WE HAVE SO FAR AFTER THIS? WE SHOULD MOVE TO THE ACTUAL SITE BEFORE CONSENSUS NEXT WEEK
- **gUbGuuB (5/2 8:10 AM):** AH, NVM NOT BEFORE CONSENSUS THEN. HAVE GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME TO WORK ON THE ACTUAL SITE. APPOLD IS MOSTLY HELPING WITH RESEARCH AND STUFF, SO THIS BROCHURE SITE WE SHOULDN'T SPEND MUCH MORE TIME ON
- **sdelaney (5/2 4:37 PM):** Anastasia Labs style advanced features section
- **sdelaney (5/5 5:35 PM):** proof of concept for a fancy roadmap page. before I put more time into polishing it up - is this too much?
- **King David (5/5 5:58 PM):** mock #3 [Images]
- **gUbGuuB (5/5 6:01 PM):** NICE! NOTES COULD BE NIGHT BOTTOM CAN BE CHANGED TO A SHADPW FROM AN ACTUAL SUNDIAL ON THE TOP. BITCOIN AS THE SUN. AND HOLES IN THE SUNDIAL CUTOUT WITH THE WORDS SO IT HAS IT IN THE SHADIQ
- **sdelaney (5/6 8:05 AM):** the sundial shadow shouldn't be too hard, but the cutout words sounds pretty hard. I'll givem a try. btc as the sun should be easy
- **sdelaney (5/6 8:22 AM):** I like the flat hero section! looks v good. thinking a combination of 1, 2 up top & 6 below with the features section from 4. @Sheldon you mind if I tweet this on my personal account just to show off the effect? Hid the sundial branding so it won't get connected to this project if we decide not to go with it.
- **Sheldon (5/6 10:40 AM):** Super cool. APPROVED!

**May 12 â€“ June 24, 2025**

- **sdelaney (5/12 4:03 PM):** shadow ðŸ™‚ (also did a reflection in case we prefer that)
- **gUbGuuB (5/12 5:50 PM):** started a thread: shadow ðŸ™‚
- **sdelaney (5/20 4:31 PM):** new responsive navbar based on design mocks â€” https://sundial-web-git-sam-navbar-ikigai-technologies.vercel.app/
- **sdelaney (5/21 11:12 AM):** new hero section - version 1 â€” https://sundial-web-git-sam-hero-ikigai-technologies.vercel.app/
- **King David (5/21 2:21 PM):** Mock #4 to reference [Images]
- **sdelaney (5/21 2:35 PM):** are there gonna be more mocks coming or are these all the mocks
- **King David (5/21 3:01 PM):** final mocks unless anyone else has ideas. looking for feedback to set the direction of branding.
- **sdelaney (5/29 5:35 PM):** team section from v4 (that vid also shows the narrower navbar you requested @King David)
- **sdelaney (5/29 5:55 PM):** started a thread: team section from v4
- **sdelaney (6/5 3:40 PM):** maintenance overlay for pages we're not ready to make public yet - also tried out the text scramble effect anastasia labs uses all over their site
- **sdelaney (6/6 4:15 PM):** news section prototype - not based on any design but realized it could be valuable
- **sdelaney (6/12 5:12 PM):** Whitepaper on the site
- **gUbGuuB (6/13 11:58 AM):** CLEAAN
- **sdelaney (6/16 8:32 AM):** Think we'll probably want a different hero graphic here that puts less emphasis on the role of Cardano/Ada. Cardano is unpopular with investors, who are the primary target for v1 of the site. BTC focused hero graphic
- **sdelaney (6/21 3:50 PM):** Added scroll snap to the site, think it makes the sunbeams feel a lot better
- **sdelaney (6/24 7:12 PM):** Still some beautification to do but the website is close enough now that we should start working on the copy. Who should I work with to get that done? @gUbGuuB @Sheldon?

**September 2025**

- **sdelaney (9/5 8:13 AM):** Here's a first draft of the financial dashboard @King David interested in feedback if you have it
- **sdelaney (9/12 10:32 AM):** Have a request to add the word Sundial somewhere at the top of the mobile page. Thoughts? [Image]
