# Operators

Operators are the backbone of the Sundial protocol, responsible for maintaining the network's integrity and performance. They play a crucial role in ensuring that transactions are processed efficiently and securely.

## L2 Operators

### Responsibilities

Operators have several key responsibilities, including:

- **Transaction Processing**: Operators are responsible for processing transactions on the network, ensuring that they are valid and adhere to the protocol's rules.
- **Network Maintenance**: Operators play a crucial role in maintaining the health and performance of the network, monitoring for any issues or anomalies that may arise.
- **Incentive Alignment**: Operators are incentivized to act in the best interests of the network, with rewards tied to their performance and the overall health of the ecosystem.

### Incentivization

To become an operator on the Sundial network, participants must stake a certain amount of capital as collateral, aligning their interests with the rules of the protocol.

This collateral serves as a guarantee that operators will act in accordance with the protocol's rules and will be penalized for any malicious behavior. Should an operator attempt to act against the protocol's rules, they risk losing their staked collateral to any single alert watcher without making any permanent changes to the ledger.

Because of the deterministic nature of the protocol, the malicious operator takes on all risk in such a scenario, and the contesting watcher takes on no risk at all.

In addition, we include a service that monitors operator performance and provides feedback on their activities. This helps to ensure that operators are held accountable for their actions and that they are incentivized to act in the best interests of the network.

If the operators fail to meet the required standards, they may be penalized by being temporarily suspended from the network. [REVIEW] This helps to maintain a high level of performance and reliability within the operator community.

## Bridge Operators

Much of what bridge operators will do is still TBD as we work with different bridging solutions. More to come as we finalize our approach.
