# Sundial Layer 7: User Layer

The User Layer is the topmost layer of the architecture, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the protocol. The focus in this layer is providing the best user experience possible for end users, operators and watchers participating in Bitcoin DeFi.

## User Interfaces

These are intended to face end-users, providing them with the tools they need to interact with the protocol easily and intuitively. This includes 3 interfaces. Each one will have a web interface, as well as mobile applications for iOS and Android.

Interfaces:

- Financial Dashboard
- Chain Explorer
- Network Status Dashboard

## Watcher Toolkit

Watcher infrastructure is intended to be lightweight, modular and composable. The target user for Watchers is expected to be moderately technical, with some familiarity with the underlying technologies. Thus, the toolkit will provide a range of resources to help users get started quickly and easily.

Specifically, the Watcher Toolkit includes:

- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and references for setting up and using the toolkit.
- **CLI Tools**: for advanced users to interact with the toolkit.
- **GUI**: A graphical user interface for users who prefer a visual approach to managing their services.
- **Containerized Applications**: Pre-packaged applications that can be easily deployed and managed in a containerized environment.

## Operator Toolkit

The Operator Toolkit is a suite of tools that allows operators to manage and monitor their services effectively. It includes:

- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and references for setting up and using the toolkit.
- **CLI Tools**: for users to interact with the toolkit.
- **Containerized Applications**: Pre-packaged applications that can be easily deployed and managed in a containerized environment.

Because the operator is expected to have considerable buy-in & technical skill, the operator toolkit is designed to be powerful and flexible, allowing operators to customize their workflows and integrate with other tools as needed.
