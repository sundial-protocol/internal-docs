# Sundial User Interfaces

One of the most important parts of providing a good user experience is the actual interface design. This includes not only the visual aspects but also the overall usability and accessibility of the interfaces.

Interfaces:

- Financial Dashboard
- Chain Explorer
- Network Status Dashboard

These are intended to face end-users, providing them with the tools they need to interact with the protocol easily and intuitively. This includes 3 interfaces. Each one will have a web interface, as well as mobile applications for iOS and Android.
