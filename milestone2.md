As required, this Public GitHub repository contains the finalized technical specifications, with specific details covered including:

## Optimised transaction processing for institutional volumes

In `architecture/scaling.md`, we talk about 
- increased block size to enhance tx flow volume
- increased operator commitment to enhance tx flow velocity
- use of watchers to facilitate movement between chains in a trustless custodial manner

### Advanced mempool management for predictable execution

In `architecture/roles/watchers.md` we discuss the decentralized network of Facilitators that will be incentivized to monitor the network and ensure that transactions are processed in a timely and efficient manner. This will help ensure transactions are executed as rapidly as possible without the need for a centralized mempool.

## Efficient reward distribution mechanisms

In `architecture/roles/roles.md` we discuss the different incentivization models we have in mind for ensuring community members have an appropriate risk/reward ratio.

We also elaborate on this in `architecture/roles/watchers.md` and `architecture/roles/operators.md`. TODO

## Scalable infrastructure designed for growing demand

In `architecture/scaling.md`, we cover
- the technically infinite TPS allowed by Sundial 
- pursuit of more capable block producers as necessary
- the fully parallelized system for rapid asset transfer using Facilitator Watchers
